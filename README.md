# File_Handling
File handling in Java allows you to interact with files on your computer, such as reading data from them or writing data to them. It's like a way for your Java programs to talk to files, much like you open a book to read or write something in it.

Key Players

File Class: Think of this as a file or folder manager. You can use it to create, delete, or check if a file exists.

FileInputStream and FileOutputStream: These are like special pipes for reading and writing data in the form of ones and zeroes. They're handy for non-text files, like images.

FileReader and FileWriter: These are like magical translators that help you read and write text from and to files. They are great for working with plain text files.

Reading a File

To read data from a file, you use FileReader or FileInputStream. Imagine you want to read a story from a book. You open the book (the file) and start reading it, one page at a time. In Java, we do this by opening a file, creating a FileReader or FileInputStream, and then reading the data, often line by line.

Writing to a File

To write data to a file, you use FileWriter or FileOutputStream. It's like you're the author, and you're jotting down a new story in a blank book. In Java, you open the file for writing, use a writer, and start writing your data.
